# MFC Database Reader
This is a simple database reader for MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) applications. 
The goal of this MFC App was to get a connection to a test database and read the rows.

I used [heavily] a tutorial from [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mfc/mfc_database_classes.htm) 
to get started with MFC and ODBC.

Thank-you tutorialspoint for the tutorial.
